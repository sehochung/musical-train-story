Once upon a time, there was a young man named Seho.
He lived in the city of New York. 

Seho loved the city, the people in it,
and especially the food.                   Menzia

Seho's good at baking so he decided to open up a
cake cafe and spread happiness to people with sweet
tooth.                                     Linyi
