Once upon a time, there was a young man named Seho.
He lived in the city of New York. 

Seho loved the city, the people in it,
and especially the food.                   Menzia

Seho's good at baking so he decided to open up a
cake cafe and spread happiness to people with sweet
tooth.                                     Linyi

Although seho opened up a cake cafe, there were numerous compliants from others
asking why everything was so sweet. Seho loved sugar so he put more sugar than what
the normal average amount of sugar. This led for his business to close down
because everyone started getting cavities.

Seho was so sad about this.  All he wanted was to share his love of
baking and sweets.  While sad and lonely Seho decided to come up with
a new idea.  To open a bakery that had less sweets and sugar.
